used by me to jot down notes to remember. Not very entertaining and does not help with the project for anyone other then me or possible contributors

## Ratelimits
using **POST** to a channel returns headers with x-ratelimit\* values, GET requests to a channel seems not to.
**HOWEVER** as per the [Global Rate Limit](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/rate-limits#global-rate-limit) 50 requests per second is the max amount of requests you are allowed to make to the API regardless of path. I am guesstimating that this global rate limit is what *borked* the bot trying to init after my internet shortage as it made 200+ GET requests probably within that timeframe as I did not account for the global rate limit. This is something I need to take into account
