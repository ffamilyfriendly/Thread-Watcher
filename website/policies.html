                    <h3>In Logs</h3>
                    <p>Logs may contain thread snowflakes, channel snowflakes, and guild snowflakes. These logs are instrumental when locating and patching bugs. The logs are accesible by the maintainer(s) only.</p>

                    <h2>Removal of Data</h2>
                    <p>Channel data can be manually removed by using /auto to toggle the watch status of the channel to off. Thread data is not removed when a thread is un-watched. If you want to remove all data you can do so by kicking the bot from the guild as long as the bot is online. </p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>In the event that you can not remove data by kicking the bot you may contact me directly at <a href="mailto:privacy@threadwatcher.xyz">privacy@threadwatcher.xyz</a></p>
