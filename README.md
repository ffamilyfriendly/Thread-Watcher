# Thread Watcher version 2
Thread Watcher is getting a full rewrite as the old codebase is quite messy and has no support for sharding.

## When?
No time of completion is set in stone but it is probable that the bot has been fully rewritten and tested as early as ~~late september / early october~~ when it's done ðŸ‘‰ðŸ˜ŽðŸ‘‰

## Todo
- [X] allow users to add/remove single threads
- [ ] allow users to batch add/remove threads
- [X] allow users to automatically watch all new threads in forums / text channels
- [ ] add more filtering options to /batch
- [ ] ~~allow a toggle to automagically resurrect archived threads when using /auto~~ (not doing this)
- [X] allow users to automagically watch new forum posts if they fit certain criteria (post flairs)
