# Thread Watcher

> **Thread-Watcher** is a simple to use discord bot dedicated to keeping discord threads un-archived. The bot was created as a proof of concept in early fall 2021 but has since amassed a steady user base of over 4000 servers. The bot is written using [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and runs on the [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) runtime with the [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/) library providing an easy way to interact with the discord API.
